# ShortestRemainingTimeFirst_SchedulingAlgo
This is a Java implementation of the SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) scheduling algorithm, which schedules processes based on their remaining burst time. It calculates the waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time for each process, and outputs the results along with the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
